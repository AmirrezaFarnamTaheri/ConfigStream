### Load Balancing & Vwarp Activation

**Infrastructure Improvements**
- **Load Balancing**: Redistributed sources from heavy batches (6, 10, 11, 12) into a new `batch_15` and lighter existing batches (3, 4, 5, 13) to reduce pipeline runtime.
- **Pipeline Optimization**: Enabled `FORCE_SCANNER` and `ALLOW_ACTIVE_SCANNING` in CI pipeline to activate Vwarp binary usage.
- **Vwarp Fix**: Resolved issue where vwarp binary was not being utilized, ensuring "chains" and "revived" proxies are now correctly generated.
